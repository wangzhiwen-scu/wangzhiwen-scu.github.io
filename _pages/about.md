I obtained my Ph.D. in December 2024 from the College of Computer Science at Sichuan University and subsequently join the Image Processing and Parallel Computing (IPPC) Laboratory at Southwest Petroleum University. My research focuses on multimodal (image/video/speech/3D) understanding and generation, intelligent agents, world models, AI infrastructure, and next-generation magnetic resonance imaging systems. I possess extensive industry experience in both internet companies and high-end medical device enterprises. I am currently the principal investigator of one National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Youth Project. As first author or co-author, I have published over ten papers in top-tier journals and conferences, including Cell iScience (a Cell Press journal), IEEE TMI, TCSVT, TAI, TRPMS, JBHI, CVPR, and ICASSP. I have frequently served as a reviewer for prestigious journals and conferences such as IEEE TPAMI, TNNLS, TMI, ICLR, WWW, CVPR, and ICASSP. I have rich hands-on experience in diffusion models, multimodal models, and both efficient and full fine-tuning of large language models. Additionally, I have led product teams and delivered products successfully deployed in internet commercialization and ToC user growth initiatives.

Research
======
Multimodal (image/video/speech/3D) understanding and generation, inverse problem optimization, intelligent agents, world models, AI infrastructure, next-generation imaging systems (MRI/CT/PET/microscopes, etc.), multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance logging, and more. Undergraduate students in mathematics, physics, computer science, electronic information, automation, mechanical and electrical engineering, as well as those pursuing or planning to pursue postgraduate studies (including those applying for direct entry or entrance exams), are welcome to contact me to explore the above topics or your own areas of interest. Currently, we have sufficient funding — you may choose to research in the direction of the advisor or continue in your own area of interest. For example, generative AI and intelligent agent directions can be applied to services for hundreds of millions of users; next-generation imaging systems and optimization directions can be applied to the development of high-end medical equipment.
